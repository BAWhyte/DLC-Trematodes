Posture tracking of *Himasthla rhigedana* worms using DeepLabCut (DLC). 

Deep learning and the visualization of three worms below were done using DLC and Python. Most of this was done through the DLC GUI, so there is no personal Python code to share. The file shared in this repository is the R code for my initial visualizations of the movement data, after some initial cleaning and organizing as well.

Below are animated gifs showing the general movement analysis of one body part done so far with the outputs from my trained algorithm in DLC:
